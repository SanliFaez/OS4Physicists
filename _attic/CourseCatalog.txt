# OS4Physicists
Course Description for OSIRIS (Utrecht University course catalog)

Title: Open Science for Physicists
ID: NS-PH500M

## Course goal 
In Open Science for Physicists (OS4Phys), students evaluate the best practices, concepts and conditions 
used by physicists working in- or outside academia in their professional activities and workflow.

## Learning goals:
After following this course, students will
1. understand the advantages and pitfalls of open science
2. learn to set up and contribute to digital collaborative environments like GitHub repositories
3. understand the structure of big collaborations like CERN, and how to optimally function in such an organizational system
4. learn to set up a reproducible research environment for their research projects
5. understand the role, responsibilities, and interactions of scientists within the scientific communities and with the general public
6. learn to develop a prototype for a measuring device and experiment
7. appreciate the business opportunities for scientists outside academia
8. understand the current scientific process and career paths.

During 8 weeks, students will listen to lectures, participate in team discussions, and perform team projects related to the following main topics:
 
1. why open science, how did we get here?  
2. setting up a collaborative environment (git, community rules, licensing and credit)
3. thriving in big collaborations (CERN, VIRGO, NASA) and citizen science 
4. open innovation and open hardware
5. knowledge discovery, AI based literature exploration
6. public engagement: story-telling and presentation; activism and trust in scientists
7. reproducibility: documentation for reproducibility and data storage
8. reflections on credibilyt in open science (scientific careers, professional and entrepreunial career, trustworthy science)

## Examination and Assessment
The assignments for this course are team-based and will be related to the lectures. 
Teams will be reshuffled for each exercise so that pass/fail is individually determined when project results are sufficient.
Exercises are partially assessed by peers and partially by the course coordinators and lecturers.

Final assessment: pass/fail

## Attendance: compulsory

## Course Materials: All materials for this course are open access and will be provided during the course

# Open Science for Physicists
*Overview of assignments and tutorial activities*

Most exercises in this course are done in teams. Depending on the exercise, these team are sometimes assigned by the coordinators. Otherwise, students can self-organize. To evaluate individual contributions for specified assignments, teams should also post a [CRedIT statement](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1210).

## Week 1: why open science, how did we get here?  
*keywords:* Five schools of Open Science, International context,  The Open Science conversation (NL, UU, Physics), Laboratory life, The reproducibility crisis, Fraud, Access and emancipation, Community-Discipline-Employer, Transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary science, Risks and rewards of Open Science, Opposition and counterarguments

+ **Learning basic Git:** The OS4P course is organised as a collaborative project on gitlab. Therefore, students are promptly guided to join the course repository as project members and to make their first pull requests. A more ellaborate Git tutorial is planned for week 2. 
+ **Introspection:** Students collect the new concepts from the lecture and discuss them in the break-out sessions. In the plenary lecture, they are asked to reflect on what they collectively know about these concept and if that is enough for their next career decisions.
+ **CoC**: All the students collectively write the code of conduct (CoC) of the course, first in break-out sessions, and then merge into one CoC all together.

## Week 2: setting up a collaborative environment
*keywords:* Version control, Licensing and receiving credit, Readme files and templates, Best practices for community management, Issue management and Getting Things Done (GTD), Unit testing (defensive programming), Merging forked repositories 

+ **Collaborative coding:** In two or more big teams, students have to fork a poorly-documented python project that needs troubleshooting, assign the project elements to subgroups and coordinate inter-operability and unified documentation.
+ **Clone and run competition:** Representatives of each team clone the final repository on a fresh PC and should get the code running as fast as possible.

### To prepare for week 3

+ Form teams to investigate one of the big scientific collaboration; [see list here](CourseDevelopment/Week3/Lecture3.md#list-of-projects-to-investigate).  Each teams will investigate the collaboration structure assigned to them and report back in week 3 according to [these guidelines](CourseDevelopment/Week3/bigcollab_report_MAKECOPY.md).
+ Before doing your investigation, watch the recorded lectures of dr. Niels Martens on [Introduction to big science collaborations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1giIxeLuIg) and [Credit and authorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRt1uTytWf8).

## Week 3: big science, scale vs precision vs control
*keywords:* Big-science collaborations, Citizen science, Credit and recognition, Policy and politics of science, Governance structures, Independence and thriving, Big science vs big network, Climate impacts and transformation of the research ecosystem.

+ **Big-science organization structure:** Students will, in groups of 4-8, investigate the structure, history, function, and working conditions of a big collaborations and present for the class. Presentations will receive peer-feedback.

## Week 4: documentation for reproducibility
*keywords:* Best practices for documentation, Data structures and data plans, templates and bug reports, Persistent identifiers, Machine-readable docs, Systematic review, Scripting, Compatibility, Dockers-Virtual Environments-Pinning, Best practices in data visualization, 

+ **Reproducible measurement project**: Student teams start with their measurement projects according to the requirements, define the goal and the processes, and create the documentation folder by following the lecture tips.

## Week 5: open design and open hardware; prototyping
*keywords:* Scientific design environments, Open protocols, Microcontrollers, Human-computer interface, Automation and bots, Remote labs, Materials-resources-constraints, Maintenance, Prototyping

+ **Project bazaar:** Each team presents their project to the class
+ **Reproducibility report:** Teams reproduce each-others project and write a project peer-review 

## Week 6: public engagement: story-telling and presentation; activism and trust in scientists
*keywords:* Storytelling, Science communication and journalism, Activism and trust in Science, Bounds of expertise, Academic social contract, Metaphors, Communicating uncertainty, Narratives and framing, Difficult to reach audience, Process and outcome

+ **Lay-person summary:** Each student writes a lay person summary of one of their previous or future projects
    + In pairs, the students identify the jargon in their layperson summaries, and discuss how to avoid it in the science communication (inspiration from upgoer 5)
    + Summaries will be tested using language level tools (e.g. [textstat](https://github.com/textstat/textstat), tbd)

### To prepare for week 7
Watch the [lecture of prof. Joshua Pearce](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jpearc26_uwo_ca/EXHKiseU0ExGjcIuwGHwZUYBfB5tD74PdjOI_ba428V4bw) to be prepared for the discussions and questions during the class

## Week 7: from science to business: knowledge transfer, intelectual property, and the academic social contract
*keywords:* Technology transfer, Open strategies and open science business models, Scipreneurship; starting a business, Creating impact, Forking vs contributing, Moral ambition, IP-Licensing-Conflict of interest

+ **Open canvas:** Students individually make an open (business) canvas about the potential users of the master thesis topic or a project
+ **Peer feedback:** Teams provide peer-feedback on each others canvas

### To prepare for the final assignment,
+ follow the instructions on the [story-telling exercise](https://transitionmakers.nl/tool/the-power-of-storytelling/#tabpanel-overview) to be prepared for the assignment of week 8.

## Week 8: The scientific process, beyond the PhD
*keywords:* Careers in science and beyond, Applying for scientific positions, Data stewardship, Grant writing, the PhD advantage, Mental health in academia, Preprinting and peer-review,  CV and applications, Altmetrics and visibility, Recognition and rewards, Literature and referencing, Science in transition

+ **Storytelling**: In groups of 2-4^, make a video pitch about an open science concept, whether you support or disagree. Show and tell all pitches. 

^(convince the coordinators if you want to form a smaller or larger team)

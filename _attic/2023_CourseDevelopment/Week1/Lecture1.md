## Goal: Why open science, how did we get here? 
In this lecture, student are introduced to various definitions of open science and how people and organizations are getting there from the current state of science. 
After the introducing different schools of open science students are encouraged to take a point of view on the relation of each classification to their potential future projects and to name consequences of open science for their careers, and for science in general. 
Besides that, the international context and access to scientific knowledge will be discussed, as well as the opposition to the inacted new research policies in connection with open science and the new system of recognition in academia. 
During the breakout discussions, students are asked to reflect on the barriers they see in realization of open science ideals.


## Lecture: Week 1 
**Topics covered in lecture**
- Five schools of Open Science 
- Current state of the conversation (NL, UU, Physics) 
- Access and academic emancipation
- Community-Discipline-Employer
- Laboratory life 
- The international context from the lens of [UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Wkvx_ZaFo)
- Trans-disciplinary and interdisciplinary science

### Collective activity
+ During the introductory lecture, students are asked to collect the terms and concepts they have heard about for the first time, in this lecture. 
+ In break-out sessions they will discuss these new terms and the role they percieve for these concepts in their past and future work. 
+ In the plenary session, they are asked to express their point of view on the requirements and barriers for the transformation to open science.

#### Example of classifying concepts from the lecture material
|**New Concepts**|**Familiar Concepts**|
|----------------|---------------|
| Inclusive science | Research infrastructure |
| Open licenses | Sharing software |
| Reproducibility | Traditional science |
| Social impact | Paywall |
| Accessibility | Quality of research |
| Community-Discipline-Employer | |

Students will be asked to keep a list like this in the first part of the lecture and reflect on their list during the collective exercise activity.


## Exercises: Week 1

Apart from the student activities around the main goal of this lecture, students will work on two small exercises to get prepared for the rest of the course, 

+ Beginning of the lecture: subscribing to the course gitlab repository and practicing basics of git for handling the course assignments,
+ Towards the end: Writing a Code of Conduct for this course based on [this template](./Week1/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_template.md)

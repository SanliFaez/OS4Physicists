## Goal: public engagement: the role of scientists in society; activism and trust in scientists; story-telling and presentation
After this week, students understand the role, responsibilities and interaction of scientists with scientific communities and the general public.

The students are able to formulate their opinion on the role a scientist must take in society, supported by arguments learned in class.

Furthermore, they are able to communicate their research to a general audience, using metaphors and storytelling. They can effectively communicate about uncertainty and avoid jargon.

## Keywords student familiarity check week 6
Some of the keywords in syllabus.MD are supposed to be new, while some are most probably familiar for students.

|**New Concepts**|**Familiar Concepts**|
|----------------|---------------|
|How storytelling works|Metaphors|
|Science communication and journalism|Communicating uncertainty|
|Activism||
|Trust in science||
|Bounds of expertise||
|Academic social contract||
|Narratives and framing||
|Difficult to reach audiences||


## Preparation

1. Every student reads the article by [Kirstensen _et al_ (2021)](https://jcom.sissa.it/archive/20/07/JCOM_2007_2021_A02) about how physics is represented in Dutch newspapers.

2. Every student comes with a short text (between 200 and 500 words) that they've written in the past, for example the abstract of their bachelor thesis.

3. Every student comes up with or finds a metaphore for a certain aspect of physics (e.g., black holes, turbulence, Brownian motion, ...) and forms an opinion about why that metaphore is needed and how well it captures the actual physics aspect. 

## Lecture

The schedule for the lecture is as follows:

-  09:00-9:30: Lecture by Erik van Sebille on
   - Academic social contract
   - Trust in science
   - Bounds of expertise
   - Activism

- 09:30-09:45: Break

- 09:45-10:45: Guest lecture by [Dr Julia Cramer (Leiden University)](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/julia-cramer#tab-1) on
  - Representation of physics in Dutch media
  - Narratives and framing
  - Jargon
  - Types of audiences and difficulties to reach them
  - How storytelling works
  - Metaphors
  - Hype

- 10:45-11:00: Break

- 11:00-12:30: Work on Assignment (see below)

## Assignment

**Assignment objective**: Write a layperson summary of your research that is understandable for a general audience.

**Assignment description**
1. Students individually bring (or write) an abstract/summary of 200-500 words for a previous project (e.g. their Bachelor thesis; if they don't have that they can choose a future project).
2. Students then convert this abstract/summary into a layperson summary. They can use the [template](layperson_summary_template.md) provided in this repository.
3. Students read each other's layperson summaries and give feedback on the use of jargon, the use of metaphors, communicating uncertainty and narratives and framing.
4. Students rewrite their layperson summary based on the feedback they received.
5. Students check their revised layperson summary for understandability and jargon (using the Flesch Reading Ease Score) with a language-check tool (e.g. by locally installing the tool at https://github.com/textstat/textstat)

**Assignment submission**: Students submit a gitlab merge request with their original abstract, their original layperson summary, the feedback they received from their peers, their revised layperson summary, and the output from the language-check tool.

**Assignment grading**: The students receive a pass if they submit a layperson summary that passes the language-check tool. To pass, the text has to have an [Automated Readibility Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) of less than 13.0 (i.e. undertandable for 18-year-olds).

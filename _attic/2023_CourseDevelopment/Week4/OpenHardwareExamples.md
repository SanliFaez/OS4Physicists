It can be wise to combine different projects from below. For example, option 3 and option 4 can be combined. 
Furthermore, students can do their experiments in a specific order, where they rely on each other's measurement results. If this is done in two groups with similar devices, the final results can be compared in order to show, that even a different procedure can give different results. A connection with big science can be made here.

+ **Option 1:** Build a Powerbank and perform and measure itâ€™s impedance. This can be done with typical lab devices such as a potentiostat. If there is plenty of time one such equipment on their own potentiostat.

+ **Option 2** Thermometer.

Measure average temp of students


+ **Option 3** Air quality measurement:
Assemblage of : https://www.airgradient.com/open-airgradient/instructions/diy/ 
Measure the Airquality and compare it with https://aqicn.org/city/utrecht/ 

+ **Option 4**
Pick an experiment of Phyphox which can be done on a smartphone. Let students perform this experiment, and let them compare the results with some simple statistics. 
As an example, students can measure the speed of sound (https://phyphox.org/experiment/speed-of-sound/) to calculate the outside temperature of the air with. To learn that every device is different, students can compare their results and can compare it with official weather data.

+ **Option 5** Any project with a raspberry pi pico and micro-python to make a little device, to do a measurement. 
+ 
+ **Option 6** Choose another Open hardware device and assemblage it during the tutorial in order to perform a measurement.

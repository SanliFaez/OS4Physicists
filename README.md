# OS4Physicists
Course plan and materials for the Open Science Course at the Physics Department

## Course goal 
In Open Science for Physicists (OS4Physicists), students evaluate the activities and workflow of 
a physicist working in- or outside academia, including best practices, concepts and conditions.

## Covered Topics:
+ why open science, how did we get here?  
+ setting up a collaborative environment (readme, templates, community rules, version control, licensing and credit)
+ big science (CERN, VIRGO, NASA), scale vs precision (for citizen science)
+ reproducibility: documentation for reproducibility (and data structures)
+ public engagement: story-telling and presentation; activism and trust in scientists
+ open design and open hardware; prototyping
+ from science to business: tech transfer (including open strategies), intelectual property and the academic social contract, scipreneurship
+ the scientific process (grantwriting, scientific careers, searching for a PhD position, professional and entrepreunial careers)
 
For details of the topics covered in each lecture, please look at [the Syllabus](Syllabus202x.md)

## Learning goals:
By following this course students make an attempt to 
	+ understand the advantages and pitfalls of open science
	+ learn to set up and contribute to digital collaborative environments like GitHub repositories
	+ understand the structure of big collaborations like CERN, and how to optimally function in such an organizational system
	+ learn to set up a reproducible research environment for their projects
	+ understand the role, responsibilities and interaction of scientists with scientific communities and the general public
	+ learn to develop a prototype for a measuring device
	+ appreciate the business opportunities for scientists outside academia
	+ understand the current scientific process and career paths.
 
## Assessment
The exerciese for this course are team-based. 
Teams will be reshuffled for each exercise so that pass/fail is individually determined by collecting a basket of satisfactory project results.
Exercises are partially assess by peers and partially by course coordinators and lecturers.

### For testing achivement of the learning goals.

At the beginning of the course all students will fill in a questionnaire on what they under about academia.

During the course, and at various occasions students are assessed for the ability to
	+ Participate in a debate on open science and take a standpoint on specific characteristics of this umbrella term
	+ Can set up a github project for the course, with an individual portfolio of forks of team projects
	+ Produce an application for joining an international collaboration
	+ Create a workflow for an analytical or experimental exercise that others can reproduce
	+ Give a presentation about their other assignments using skills learned in the course. 
	+ Design and/or develop a prototype
	+ Write a business case for a science-based innovation
	+ Reflect on changes in their understanding of the scientific process in comparison with the pre-course questionnaire

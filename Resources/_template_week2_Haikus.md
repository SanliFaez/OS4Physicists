# Template for the haiku assignment

## Instructions

1. Form a subteam of three students from your team.
2. As a subteam, create one branch on GitLab named `Group<groupnumber>/Haiku_<teamletter><subteamnumber>` (e.g. `Group1/Haiku_A1`).
3. Copy this Template to the Assignments subfolder, and rename it to the same name as the branch; keep the extension `.md` (e.g. `Assignments/Group1/Haiku_A1.md`).
4. One of the teammembers writes the first line of the haiku in the file on their local computer. Then pushes it to the remote.
5. The next teammember pulls and edits the file, writing the second line of the haiku in the file. Then uploads it to the branch.
6. The last teammember pulls and edits the file, and writing the third line of the haiku in the file. Then uploads it to the branch.
7. One of the students creates a Merge Request to merge the file with the haiku into the master branch.
8. The subteam assigns the other students from the team (but not from your subteam) to review the Merge Request.
9. Once the reviewers have confirmed that it is a valid haiku, they can approve the Merge Request.
10. The TA assigned to the Group merges the Merge Request.
11. Once all haikus in the group folder are merged, the students will read all haiku poems aloud and the best one will be selected by the group.

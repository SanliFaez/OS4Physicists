# Open Science for Physicists

In this folder, store the project documentation for the measurement experiment. You can make use of the suggested template subfolder by making a copy of that folder.

DO NOT RENAME THE FOLDER DIRECTLY. Make a copy first. 
If you rename the folder without making a copy, your merge request will be rejected.

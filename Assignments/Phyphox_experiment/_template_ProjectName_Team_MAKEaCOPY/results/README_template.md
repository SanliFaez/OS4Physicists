### Tips

+ Separate different runs of your analysis in separate subfolders.
+ Keep a copy of the script that you have used for generating each result, inside the subfolder, but do not copy the libraries or functions.
+ Keep results separate from (raw) data.
+ Help the other users and your future selves to find their easily in reproducing your results.

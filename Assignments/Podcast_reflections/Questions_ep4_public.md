# Open Science for Physicists

Especially for the course, we have recorded 4 podcast episodes extending the discussions of the course topics. 
Participants are asked to listen to the podcast and answer some related questions. 


## Questions for Episode 4: Public Engagement and Trust in Scientists

1. The difference between science communication and public engagement is that science communication can be viewed as the return of investment from funding by society, while public engagement centers around disseminating information on scientific advances.  
	+ True
	+ False
2. It is unclear what exactly society wants from scientists.  
	+ True
	+ False
3. An ‘honors broker’ is a scientist who: 
	+ is tasked to advise on strategic choices based on their expertise 
	+ is driven by their own motivations irrespective of societal pressures 
	+ is publicly disseminating a variety of policy options 
	+ is active in the political debate by advising which arguments are correct 
4. The perspective of the book ‘The honors broker’ discussed in the podcast is that academia is disconnected from society and that neutrality of scientists is paramount for trust in science, similarly to referees in sports matches.  
	+ True
	+ False
5. The discussion of the book ‘Why trust science’ brings up that science always progresses and the scientific ‘truth’ changes over the years as new understanding is developed. Consequently: 
	+ It is desirable that scientists remain disconnected from the political debate.  
	+ Statements by individual scientists cannot be unequivocally trusted.  
	+ A diverse group of scientists will likely be unable to come to consensus on a topic. 
6. Academic activism refers to:
	+ Academics going public with their emotions about the climate crisis and the dangers of artificial intelligence. 
	+ Academics using their perceived status to have a larger impact on the political debate.  
	+ Academics reaching out to the media on topics within their expertise that they would be comfortable teaching to a first year bachelor student. 
7. Erik gives the tip that for academic activism to have the largest impact, each scientist involved should speak out whenever they are concerned about an issue. 
	+ True
	+ False

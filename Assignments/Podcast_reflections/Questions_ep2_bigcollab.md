# Open Science for Physicists

Especially for the course, we have recorded 4 podcast episodes extending the discussions of the course topics. 
Participants are asked to listen to the podcast and answer some related questions. 


## Questions for Episode 2: Big Research Collaborations

1. What is social epistomology, according to Niels?
	+ The science of knowledge
	+ Knowledge creation in groups of people, and the social interactions between scientists
	+ The way how the social sciences work
2. What is not a general relation that Niels sees? The more authors write a paper, the more...
	+ ... the more diverse perspectives and expertise can be integrated, potentially enhancing the paper's depth and quality
	+ ... the more complex coordination and communication become, potentially leading to challenges in maintaining coherence and consistency.
	+ ... conservative is their conclusion
3. If the goal of the collaboration is to do the best science, why do these collaborations also spend time and effort to study their own communication practices?
	+ That is what the funders want them to do
	+ Collaborations realise that they can only do the best science if they include many different expertises and disciplines
	+ For the collaboration leaders not to be accused of miscommunication
4. What is Niels’ advice for how to enter a big collaboration like CERN
	+ Work as hard as you can and show up at all opportunities to be discovered
	+ Just make sure you have respect for the hierarchy and be a ‘good citizen’
	+ Make sure you’re not only a cog in the wheel, but make sure you have clear agreements how you will for example carve out an individual PhD thesis
5. What is an option for dealing with dissenting views in big collaborations
	+ Allow for ‘minority views/opinions’ in a publication
	+ Keep on discussing until everyone agrees
	+ Ignoring or dismissing the dissenting views
6. What is the optimal size of a collaboration?
	+ Thousands of people
	+ A handful of people
	+ That is not known yet
7. What are the best types of prizes
	+ Those with the largest amount of many attached to them
	+ Those for junior people
	+ Those that are most competitive
8. Giving credit is ...
	+ ... best done by the senior scientists
	+ ... not a zero-sum game
	+ ... best when it happens naturally without extra effort
9. What Feynman quote did Sanli refer to
	+ There’s plenty of room at the bottom
	+ The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool
	+ Shut up and calculate
10. What is an example of a bottom-up collaboration as Niels described it
	+ The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change)
	+ The Black Hole Horizon project
	+ CERN
11. What is an ‘analysis challenge’
	+ A point at which a collaboration reaches a crisis
	+ A way for new groups to work with (synthetic) data from others and start contributing
	+ A bug in the code that leads to a retraction

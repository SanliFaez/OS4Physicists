## Recommendations for TAs

### Do
+ Create a comfortable environment that allows individuals to share ideas openly. 
+ Understand that feedback and learning goes both ways. 
+ Allow students to embrace their mistakes as learning experiences. 
+ Be patient with students; don’t expect them to understand a new concept the first time. 
+ Be connected. Let students reach you when they have questions. 
+ Help students make a connection between what they are learning and how it is used in the real-world.  
+ Set expectations of each party - know collective goals. 
+ Face-to-face interaction helps, but when possible students can be supported via electronic communication

### Don’t
+ Don’t try to lead the project for students. Instead, share your experience and help in getting to the answers.  
+ Don’t Assume that something is too hard for the students to accomplish. Try to give them your estimate of the difficulty or requirements.

# Open Science for Physicists
*Instructions and required information for academic year 2023-24*

This note contains the specific information for the academic year 2023 for the students of OS4P (ns-ph500m) and OSTP (ns-tp506m) who follow the shared part of the two coruses.

For detailed description of the lectures, check [the Syllabus](Syllabus_202x.md). The exercises for this course are team-based. See [the list of assignments](Exercises_2023.md) for the full list.

## Welcome message on Blackboard
We are excited about this first edition of the "Open Science for Physicists". This interactive course consists of 8 lectures, given by us or external speakers, and exercises which will be performed and discussed during the sessions. Because of this interactive format, participation in the lectures are mandatory and online participation cannot be accomodated. If you are hindered on the first week, please contact the course assistant, Roosmarijn Knopper r.l.knopper@uu.nl, as soon as possible.

Lectures 1, 2, 3, and 8 are common with the "Open Science for Theoretical Physics" course (ns-tp506m). The commonalities and differences between these two sister courses will be explained in more details during the first lecture.

The course syllabus and exercises will be posted on the course repository (more information will follow). The crucial announcement will be posted on the Blackboard.

All the lectures are scheduled on Monday mornings from 9:00-12:45, starting on 11 September 2023. 
The venue is [the Learning Plaza](https://www.uu.nl/en/education/future-learning-spaces/learning-spaces/learning-plaza) in the Minnaert building (former canteen).

## What to expect? 
The OS4P course is about real-life skills and experiences of researchers in a rapidly evolving academic landscape. With the advancement of open science, students do not only need to update our idea of "how science works", but also need to know which tools are available and which skills will be necessary. Therefore, this course is a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises to get a good feeling of these new developments. 
Some of the open science practices are still not widely embraced by some factions of the scientific community. These frictions will naturally influence the post-graduate career of our students. To appreciate and form an opinion on these practices, the students are sometimes deliberately faced with uncertain circumstances, just like the real world. 
In this course, we often ask *why* a certain choice is made or practiced. Such questions are not always the most comfortable or easy to answer.  
As the course emphasizes learning from engagement, which is difficult to quantify, grading is done as pass/fail.

## OS4P and OSTP
These two courses are interlinked but follow somewhat different philosophies. OSTP is an adjusted form of the student seminar and put a higher emphasize on research skills and exploring the literature. The OS4P course encompasses a wider skill set that contains setting up measurements, public engagement, science communication, and knowledge transfer from academia to the society. There is also a larger emphasis on good documentation for reproducibility, through the practical example of a measurement project.
Students in the THPH programme are welcome to take each of the courses, or follow both. In the latter case, they will recieve the credits for *only one* of the two courses. 
As the assignments are based on team activities, the OSTP THPH students that want to also follow OS4P through are kindly asked to join _all_ the 4 extra OS4P lectures.

For the final lecture, OSTP students should be aware of the necesary preparation in advance to the lecture.

## What is expected?
To reach a deeper appreciation of the dilemma's in the way of transition to open science, we will organize a lot of group or plenary discussions. Active participation in the tutorials and discussions is more important than getting the most attention and applause for a certain exercise or project. 
We encourage you stay curious about the topics chosen for these discussions. If somethings does not match your expectation, your are kindly asked to raise those points as soon as you feel comfortable expressing it, in the class, to the student representatives in the focus group, or directly share them with the teachers.

## Feedback on the course
Since this is the first time this course is presented in this form, we are still optimizing the content of the lectures and exercises. The students' feedback are extremely important for the success of this course in the coming years. Therefore, next to the common feedback channels, we will form a focus group of students to share their feedback with us every fortnight, as we proceed. We may make adjustments to the lectures based on the discussions with these representatives. 
All students are invited to point out the shortcomings of the course or share their suggestions for improving the communicated information for higher clarity and effectiveness of the assignments and lectures. They can share their opinion directly with the coordinators, or pass it through their student representatives.

## Development goal
Students appreciate the role that scientists play in society and are able to communicate their research to a general audience.

## Motivation:
Public Engagement is an essential enabler of Open Science, as it helps to build trust in science and to ensure that the results of scientific research are used to benefit society. In this lecture, students will learn how to communicate their research to a general audience, using storytelling and metaphors. They will also learn about the role of scientists in society and the academic social contract.

## Vision of outcome
After this week, students understand the role, responsibilities and interaction of scientists with scientific communities and the general public.

The students are able to formulate their opinion on the role a scientist must take in society, supported by arguments learned in class.

Furthermore, they are able to communicate their research to a general audience, using metaphors and storytelling. They can effectively communicate about uncertainty and avoid jargon.


## Embedding/community
The general public is the main community considered when studying the topics of this lecture. However, some of the topics can also be applied to the scientific community. The students will be encouraged to think about how they can use these tools in their own research projects, and how they can use them to communicate with others in the research community.

## Methods/exercises
**Topics covered in lecture**
+ Science communication and journalism
+ Trust in science
+ Academic social contract
+ Representation of physics in Dutch media
+ How storytelling works (jargon, metaphors, hype)

## Evaluation
Write a layperson summary of your research that is understandable for a general audience.


### Assignment description
1. Students individually bring (or write) an abstract/summary of 200-500 words from a previous project (e.g. their Bachelor thesis; if they don't have that they can choose a future project).
2. Students then convert this abstract/summary into a layperson summary.
3. Students read each other's layperson summaries and give feedback on the use of jargon, the use of metaphors, communicating uncertainty and narratives and framing.
4. Students rewrite their layperson summary based on the feedback they received.
5. Students check their revised layperson summary for understandability and jargon (using the Automated Readibility Index) with a language-check tool (e.g. by locally installing the tool at https://github.com/textstat/textstat)
6. Students receive a pass if they submit a layperson summary that passes the language-check tool. To pass, the text has to have an [Automated Readibility Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) of less than 13.0 (i.e. be undertandable for 18-year-olds).

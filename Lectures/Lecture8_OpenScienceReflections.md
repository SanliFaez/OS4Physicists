## Development goal
 To reflect on the key concepts in open science that we have discussed in this course. 
 To practice storytelling and video production skills in creating a short (scientific) pitch.
 
## Motivation: 
The last lecture of the course is an opportunity to reflect back on what has been discussed and learned, and what are the main take aways from this course. 
The symposium format allows the participants to also create an overall impression of what standpoints their peers have developed.

## Vision of outcome
+ Participants choose a conscious position of how to practice open science in the next phases of our scientific career.
+ Course participants can appreciate the logical reasoning behind choosing the selection of topics that are covered in this course.

## Embedding/community

The videos in this symposium are prepared by the participants for the other participants and other potential stakeholders that can benefit from more awareness about the open science concepts.

## Methods/exercises

+ Students are distributed in teams of 3-4 to select an open science concept from the list below, or a similar statement they choose, and express their conviction about this topic in a video pitch of 90 seconds. Instructions for making a successful pitch are provided in the link under the preparation section.

+ After watching all the videos in the class, each student distributes 100 points between the presented pitches based on how convincing they find that video.

### Open science concepts

+ The reproducibility crisis does (not) matter because ... 
+ Fraud in science, can (not) be fixed with open science.
+ Transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary science is an oximoron (essential for solving urgent societal issues).
+ Open science practices are risky because ...
+ Open science practices are rewarding because ...
+ Opposition to open science is legitimate because ...
+ Version control is (not) essential for every type of collaborative project.
+ Creative commons licensing shoud be left to lawyers.
+ Readme files are overrated (underrated), because ...
+ Template files are restrictive (helpful), because ...
+ Community management is essential for a big collaboration.
+ Community management is not a scientific practice and should not be counted as one (e.g. in promotion).
+ Big-science collaborations are more (less) self correcting than small research groups.
+ Citizen science is a PR ploy of funding agencies.
+ Citizen science can (never) be as accurate as science done by professionals.
+ Great science and code speaks for itself, documentation is just a burden.
+ Poorly documented code cannot be trusted.
+ Data structures and data plans are a waste of time.
+ A data-intensive project without a data plan cannot be trusted.
+ Efforts to make articles machine readable is a waste of resources.
+ Forcing authors to make their data available before publication is legitimate (wasting their time).
+ Maintenance of open source projects should (not) be part of scientists' job description.
+ Open-source hardware cannot be trusted for serious scientific work.
+ Open-source hardware is necessary for making science accessible.
+ Open Science should (not) be a mandatory part of our master program.
+ Science communication is part of the job of a journalist, not a scientists
+ Activism hurts the trust in scientists 
+ The most important job/role of scientists is to: ...
+ Technology transfer is a distraction for fundamental research
+ Open science can (never) be a profitable business
+ The real impact of research can (never) be measured
+ Careers in open science are less (more) rewarding than traditional science careers
+ Data stewardship is a part of the researchers' duties 
+ Data stewardship is a service that should be done by librarians
+ Of the five schools of Open Science,I would advocate for
	+ Public school
	+ Infrastructure school
	+ Pragmatic school
	+ Measurement school
	+ Democratic school

## Evaluation
+ After watching all the videos in the class, each student distributes 100 points between the presented pitches based on how convincing they find that video.

## Instructions 

+ for creating a pitch
	1. Begin by outlining the core message or goal of your pitch. Clearly state what issue are you aiming to address and for whom.
	2. Identify the main features, benefits or unique selling points of your project. Highlight what sets it apart from existing solutions or approaches.
	3. Structure your pitch in a logical and engaging manner. Consider including an attention-grabbing introduction, a concise explanation of the problem or need, a description of your solution or idea and a compelling conclusion.
	4. Ensure that your pitch is concise, coherent and easy to understand. Avoid jargon or technical terms that may confuse your audience.
	5. Once you have finalised the written pitch, take it a step further by visualising the key elements of your idea using illustrations, diagrams or sketches. This will help communicate your concept more effectively.
	6. Review and refine your written pitch, ensuring they align with the overall message and goals of your project. Seek feedback from your peers or teacher and make necessary adjustments to enhance clarity and impact.
+ for recording and editting a clear video
	1. location: choose a a quiet environment and avoid distracting backgrounds
	2. acoustics: pay special attention to sound quality and make sure your recorded voice is clearly and consistently audible
	3. camera: record at the proper distnace of about one meter, and with camera positioned at the eye-level.

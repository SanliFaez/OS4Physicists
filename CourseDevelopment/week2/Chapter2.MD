+ Feedback on lecture format
+ Feedback on tutorial format

## Goal: setting up a collaborative environment
After this week, one is able to set up a collaborative environment on Github.

## Keywords student familiarity check week 2
Some of the keywords in syllabs.MD are supposed to be new, while some are most probably familiar for students.

|**New Concepts**|**Familiar Concepts**|
|----------------|---------------|
|Licensing and receiving credit| Version control |
|Best Practices for Community management| Active and passive versioning |
|Project management and Getting Things Done (GTD)| Readme files and templates |
|Unit testing (defensive programming)| Merging forked repositorie |


## Lecture: Week 2 
**Topics in lecture**

Licensing and receiving credit | Best Practices for Community management | Project management and Getting Things Done (GTD)

### Lecture format

The second lecture will be a combination of short videos alternated with some reading. The Lecture consists out of 3 parts, which are distributed to a general Github. In the tutorial students are going to fork it! 

1. **Video:** 60 Sec explanation about Licensing and receiving credit. Presented in “bullet points”. These bullet points are not necessary bullet points like in a slideshow, but are different scenes in the video where somebody explains it. This can be a real person or a cartoon. Also an animation is possible. The video ends with a clickable link, where people can find more information. 

2. **Video:** A 5 min interview on video with a experienced open science community manager. In the interview best Practices for Community management are shared, together with some examples in real life. 

3. **Exploring**: Project management and Getting Things Done (GTD). A free, individual exploration on https://gettingthingsdone.com/resources/  for aprox. 30 min. 


## Tutorial: Week 2
**Topics in tutorial:**

Unit testing (defensive programming) | Version control | Active and passive versioning | Readme files and templates | Merging forked repositorie


### Tutorial format
**Assignment objective**
To practise with the topics above, the students are invited to fork the repository of the lecture. This repository contains the videos and links discribed and 1 python program with 4 parts. The groups are the same as in the first tutorial. Every group gets a specific task, see possible deliverables. 

By pulling their work, each group can interact with the student-assistant in order to practise with the workflow. It is NOT allowed to meet in person during this tutorial, in this way people can practise with digital collaboration. 

At the end of the tutorial, the repository contains:
+ The videos and links of the lecture
+ A tested an updated python file (See 1. below)
+ The group specific projects in separated folders (See 2. below)

This repository can be created every year again or it can be a growing repository, with lots of different projects on the topics of week 2. 

**Possible deliverables**
  1. All groups have to test a part of the python software. Some specific changes in the software has to be made.

  2. Each group can choose between:
      1. Some groups can search for an open source initatives. They try to track down the workflows and they try to add something. The workflow are combined in a .MD file and added to the forked repository. In this way the students can practise with version control and with crediting another project.
      2. Some groups can search for open source data sets and try to visualize them in a fancy way. The group have to calculate something new with the existing data. The new data set can be stored on the repository, which then can be pulled. In this way students can practis with version control
      3.  Some groups can search for an open source AI, such as DALLE-2 or craiyon. With this software, students are going to study a topic they like in a systematic way by changing the input a bit. After every iteration, they ask for a pull request on pulling the results on the repopsitory. In this way the students can practise with version control and with crediting another project.As an example, they can ask dalle-2 the following: 
            +  first iteration: "An apple with a blue hat and two legs cycling on a bike in front of the empire state building, painted by dali."
            +  second iteration: "An pine-apple with a blue hat and two legs cycling on a bike in front of the empire state building, painted by dali."
            +  ...
 
**Assignment preparation**
  + Students have to discuss in a teams/zoom environment how they are working together

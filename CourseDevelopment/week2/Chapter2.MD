## Goal: setting up a collaborative environment
After this week, one is familiar with the structure of a collaborative environment on Github or Gitlab, and can set a new one up.

## Keywords student familiarity check week 2
Some of the keywords in [syllabus](./syllabus.md) are supposed to be new, while some are most probably familiar for students.

/* To BE DISCUSSED, should we do this for each lecture? Will it work in the first trial?*/
|**New Concepts**|**Familiar Concepts**|
|----------------|---------------|
| Licensing | Version control |
| Community management | Active and passive versioning |
| Getting Things Done (GTD) | Readme files and templates |
| Unit testing (defensive programming) | Merging forked repositorie |
| All Contributions | recieving credit |


## Lecture: Week 2 
**Topics in lecture**

Licensing and receiving credit | Best Practices for Community management | Project management and Getting Things Done (GTD)

### Lecture format

The second lecture will have two parts. I

1. **Good enough data analysis and reporting** 
    30-40 minutes lecture on best practices for setting up a collaborative research environment based on the course of Barbara Vreede and [this article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510&ref=https://githubhelp.com)

2. **Project management**: 
    - Project management and using issues/labels, introduction to Getting Things Done (GTD) boards. 
    - Some tips and suggestions effective collaboration and project managment on git platforms

## Tutorial: Week 2
**Topics in tutorial:**
- Between the two lectures, students will be given a complex coding task to complete in two teams, starting from forking an incomplete repository and then making the complete project work as a group! 
- To make sure that every student practices the basic git commands, every student must be able to run the final program on their PC

### keywords
Unit testing (defensive programming) | Version control | Active and passive versioning (?) | Readme files and templates | Merging forked repositories


### Tutorial format
**Assignment objective**

The programming assignment will be based on analysing experimental data with the laptop sound card and deriving some commong physical properties. Elements of the code are provided to the students in a poorly-documented repository. In two separate teams, students should form a code production line that results in a working repository that works on every individual PC.

 
**Assignment preparation**
  + Students have to discuss in a teams on distribution of task, timing and how they are working together
  + >>> Further steps will be added when the assignment is ready <<<

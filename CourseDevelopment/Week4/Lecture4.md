## Lecture: Week 4
**Topics in lecture** An overview of best practices on documentation for reproducibility, as well as sharing of open data and open results.

### Lecture format 
**Goal:**  After this lecture students have an overview of best practices in documenting a project. They will also be able to assess what the best route is for them to publish data under FAIR principles.

**Student preparation:** Look in your own archives and check how you stored the documents and data of one of their previous projects, such as your bachelor project. What was the document structure and was it useful? Can someone use your documents to reproduce your results?

**Lecture format** 
+ There will be a presentation about: Machine-readable docs | Systematic review | Persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI) |  GDPR and privacy rules | Scripting
+ A representative of the eScience Centre will give a presentation about best practices in documentation. Students can ask questions and take notes. These are needed in the tutorial. 
    + Suggestion: We can ask Barbara Vreede to give a presentation about "Best practices in writing scientific code" b.m.i.vreede@uu.nl

See below for a summary of best practices by
Wilson G, Bryan J, Cranston K, Kitzes J, Nederbragt L, et al. (2017) Good enough practices in scientific computing. PLOS Computational Biology 13(6): e1005510. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510

## Tutorial: Week 4
**!WARNING:**This is a first draft of week 4. An experienced person have to further develop the described assignments in detail. 
From the point of view of students (future physicists). It is a bit dry course material, so a large focus on the tutorial session can help students the most. To let them prepare for future research projects it may be relevant to: create a folder structure of an arbitrary open science project. The same holds for setting up a systematic review or a python environment. 

**Topics in tutorial:**
Data structures and data plans | Best practices in data visualization | GDPR and privacy rules | templates and bug reports | Persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI) |Machine-readable docs | Systematic review | Scripting | Compatibility | Dockers-Virtual Environments-Pinning | [Data publishing routes](https://dmeg.cessda.eu/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/6.-Archive-Publish/Data-publishing-routes)

**Goal:** In this tutorial students will create a template of standard documentation, which they can use later in their career. Furthermore students know how to perform a systematic review.

**Students Preparation:** See lecture preparation

**Grading:** Students hand 3 things: 1. their document structure, 2. project documents 3. the reproduction results of other students project. Everything will be be handed in by a pull request on the course's Github page. In this request, students create a folder with their own name, and add per task their hand-ins. In a README. MD, students explain briefly what they handed in. Not everything has to be perfect, but if all the steps are taken seriously, students can get a pass.

**The Idea:** 

+ **1. Create documents and a folder structure**
  + Create a folder on your computer and call it, STUDENTNUMBER_WEEK4
  + The goal of this exercise is to create a folder structure inside this new folder
  + Create a folder structure as described in box 1 above. Not every step or document in this list can be made, instead create a dummy document. This exercise is to practice good practices and to see all the steps. For example, 3.collaboration.b, can be an empty to-do list in the form of an MD file. When this folder structure is on a repository, one can fork and pull this to-do document to make changes.

  + After you are done, you can fork the repository of this course, and upload your folder with the correct name. Now it is ready to be merged in the main, by a pull request. This process needs to be coordinated by a TA. 
  + A impression of a folder structure with standard documents, (!Not complete!):

+ **2. Project**
    + In the just created folder structure, students can store project documents. 
    + They are free to do any project they like, which is doable in the tutorial time. Also the project has to be reproducible, so complicated codes, exotic program's etc. are not allowed. 
    + The TA has to approve the project. 

    + **Example project: Prepare a systematic review and write a reproduction manual**
        + Students pick a topic which is relevant for them. Then they write down a search query in google scholar. See: https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/c.php?g=745384&p=5361954
        + Download the first 100 articles in your search queries and store them in Zotero by entering DOI's
        + Download ASReview: https://asreview.nl/
        + Upload The zotero database in ASReview and scan 6 articles on relevance based on their abstract.
        + After that, ASReview will generate an order of articles for you. Go through these ordered articles and stop when articles are not relevant anymore.
        + The resulting articles, i.e., the first few, will be the articles you will study in a systematic review.
        + For reproducibility think of: What choices did I made, What keywords did I used, .. etc? A reproduction should give the same resulting articles. 
        + Are there constrains or systematic errors in the Systematic Review process? (Hint: is Googles ranking for everybody the same?)

    + **Example project: Create a python environment to run a script and write a reproduction manual**
        + Create a pull request on the course Github page.
        + Create a folder called, STUDENTNUMBER_ENV
        + Create a python environment, where you install a package. For example, PYQT5 can be installed. This is a package, used often in experimental physics and is never installed as a standard. 
        + If PyQT is not relevant for you, or a bit to advanced, use Pandas, Numpy and matplotlib to do a simple data manipulation and print some graphs.
        + Create a new python file in this environment and Create something simple with it. Want to do something more advanced? See for example: https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/ 
        + Or use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVpho_UiDAY to build a GUI
        + If PyQT is not relevant for you, or a bit to advanced(!), use Pandas, Numpy and matplotlib to do a simple data manipulation and print some graphs
        + Upload your environment and your code at the forked repository. 
        + Finish with a pull request.
        + Note, setting up an environment can be hard for the first time: 
            + Open command window and use commands as below
            + see: https://Docs.Conda.Io/Projects/Conda/En/4.6.0/_Downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/Conda-Cheatsheet.Pdf
            + Commands example

+ **3. ReproduceReproduceReproduceReproduce**
    + After setting up your folder structure and adding your project documents, other students have to reproduce your results
    + Use the reproducibility feedback as a guide.
    + Pull your reproduced answers in the projects github folders.

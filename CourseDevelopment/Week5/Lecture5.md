## Goal: open design and open hardware
After this week, one is familiar with the concept of open science in hardware development. Students get familiar with finding open hardware recipes and know how to contribute to them. After the lecture students can explain in a discussion what challenges open hardware can solve and what socio-economic issues are involved.

## Tutorial: reproducing project and peer evaluation
In the first part of the course, students have to reproduce the projects of another team, solely based on their documentation, and write are report based on [this template](peer_evaluation_FORWHICHPROJECT.md). This exercise will take about 75 minutes.

## Lecture: Week 5 
"Open hardware for the Common Good", Plenary talk for the PSSOH 2023 conference.

**keywords:** Scientific design environments, University knowledge transfer, Open protocols, Sustainably development, Automation and bots, Remote labs, Materials-resources-constraints, Defense and national security, Maintenance, Prototyping

Answer the questions: 
+ How does the future of hardware look like in 2030, 2040 and 2050? Answer in 5 keywords. 
+ What role can open hardware take in society?

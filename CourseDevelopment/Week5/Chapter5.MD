## Goal: public engagement: story-telling and presentation; activism and trust in scientists
After this week, students understand the role, responsibilities and interaction of scientists with scientific communities and the general public. 
Students have to give a presentation about their other assignments using skills learned in the course. 
Further, the studends are able to formulate their opinion in a discussion on the role a scientist must take in a public debate.

## Lecture: Week 5

**Preparation:** Read article about how physics is represented in Dutch newspapers. https://jcom.sissa.it/archive/20/07/JCOM_2007_2021_A02

**Part 1** A short “classic” lecture of 25 min on:\
Academic social contract\
Bounds of expertise\
Naratives and framing\
trust in science\
Difficulties to reach audience\
process and outcome\
trust in science\

**Part 2** Guest lecture & Discussion (60 min)\
On representation of physics in the Netherlands\
Lecture by e.g. Julia Cramer (Leiden), followed up by a plenary discussion.


## Tutorial Week 5: What is the role of a scientist in society?\
(2x 60 min)
\
**Topics in tutorial:**\
Metaphors | Communicating uncertainty | possible roles of a scientist

### Tutorial format
+ **Assignment objective**
Students practice presenting and express their points of view, by reflecting on their role as a future scientist. They will use metaphors to communicate topics of their bachelor research. 

+ **Possible Assignments**
Students can choose between:
++ *A plenary discussion*\
Students are devided in groups of 8. In the first our of the tutorial session, each group will prepare 5 statements for a plenary debate. 
The statements should anwer questions such as: ...\
**TODO:** what type of questions need to be answerd?\
For every statement, their should be arguments formulated aganst it and in favor of the statement.\

In the second hour of the tutorial all statements go in a (virtual) jar. Five of them will be selected at random.
After that, the group bringing in this statement will introduce it in a few words and the debate wil start (10 min). 
To keep the discussion running, the prepered arguments can be trown in.


++ *A Pitch*\
Students present a pitch of 3 min, to explain why, their bachelor thesis is relevant for society. 
The first hour can be used for preparations. In the second part, all pitchers come to gether to do their pitch. 
\
\
**TODO:** How should these assignments be graded?
+ Use of methaphores
+ Communicating uncertainty in a clear way
+ Reflect on personal role as a scientist

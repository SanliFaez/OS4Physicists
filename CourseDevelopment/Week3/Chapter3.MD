## Goal: big science, scale vs precision vs control

## Keywords student familiarity check week 3
Some of the keywords in syllabs.MD are supposed to be new, while some are most probably familiar for students.

|**New Concepts**|**Familiar Concepts**|
|----------------|---------------|
|Big-science collaborations ||
|Citizen science ||
|Credit and recognition ||
|Policy and politics of science ||
|Governance structures||
|Relativism of big, Climate impacts and transformation||
|Independence and thriving||


## Lecture: Week 3
**Topics in lecture**
Big-science collaborations | Citizen science | Policy and politics of science | Governance structures | Relativism of big, Climate impacts and transformation


### Lecture format
**Part 1: Videos**
This week will be on campus, where short videos will be screened during the first part of the lecture. 

Two “Drawing” videos to explain (inspiration and inspiration)
1. Governance structures
    1. Dutch structure of science: Ministry, EU-union, universities, NWO, KNAW, other actors/stakeholders. 
    2. Who pays dutch science? 

2. Science policy/funding terms
    1. Tender, acquisition, Back Office, stakeholders, industry-academia collaboration, Funding, Big budget, big staff, big machines, big laboratories, applications


A set of videos, ~ 3 min each, or a compilation of them in which Big-scientific collaborations are discussed. 
1. Each project is introduced  by a voice over, while seeing relevant video content or a drawing video (1 min).
2. Of each project, there will be a “talking head”. A person from the collaboration, will explain a bit about the way of teamwork in the video or about the policy/funding terms. (2 min) 

3. Possible big-science projects are: 
    1. Cern (Experimental & theory)
    2. Ligo / Virgo (Experiment & theory)
    3. ITER (experiment & Theory)
    4. NWO (general)
    5. Qutech/Quantum Delta/Quantum Software consortium (Experimental & Theory)
    6. IPCC (Climate)
    7. NASA/ESA (experimental, Climate, Cosmology)
    8. SC3 - center for social complexity and climate change (Modeling, a possible workfield of graduated physicists)
    9. NESSC (Climate)
    10. Critical earth (Climate)
    11. **Extra**: Manhattan project (Dark history of physics..), talking head can be Oppenheimer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac This must be of course presented with some warnings/caution! The main message of this video will be: Be aware of where you work on!


**Part 2: Presentations**

Teachers and one amateur scientist will give a short presentation covering the following topics: 

1. **Policy and politics of science** Overview of relevant science policies in a big scheme or in a step-by-step approach. In this way the students can take notes, and use it directly when they proceed in science.
A personal story or summary of politics in science, and what to be aware of as a future scientist.

2. **Relativism of big, Climate impacts and transformation** 
presentation of 10 min. with anecdotes, role of social media, example of Gerrit himstra? https://mobile.twitter.com/gerrithiemstra/with_replies 

3. *Citizen science guest “lecture”* Examples of citizen participation. Story from the field: A personal story of an amateur scientist. (10 min. talk, 10 min questions)


## Tutorial: Week 3
**Topics in tutorial:**

Credit and recognition | Independence and thriving | Lecture topics 

### Tutorial format
+ **Assignment objective**
Reflect on own bachelor thesis in terms of credit and recognition. Furhter think of the lecture topics in terms of an fictive application. 

+**Possible deliverables**

>**Meme your own bachelor thesis!** Make 2 memes showing: You understand the principles of crediting and recognition. Ask yourself questions like: Did I published my data open? Did I cited correctly? Is my research reproducible? 

>**Meme competition** Make 5 Memes with your group which serves as a schematic application & reflection for joining an international collaboration. The collection of memes contains memes about: 
++ Big Science collaborations: Which organisation do you apply for and what is the end-goal?
++ Governance & Funding: How do you use the money and where does it come from?
++ Relativism: what can be possible critics?
++ Citizen science: How to incorporate citizens in your research?
++ Science Policies: What steps to take?

>**1 pager: Application for a big-science project** Make an application for a big science collaborations with your group in max 500 words (~100 per topic). 
++ Big Science collaborations: Which organisation do you apply for and what is the end-goal?
++ Governance & Funding: How do you use the money and where does it come from?
++ Relativism: what can be possible critics?
++ Citizen science: How to incorporate citizens in your research?
++ Science Policies: What steps to take?


>**Rules for the memes**
++The course is intended to be a safespace to discuss topics related to open science. This does not mean that any meme, or other form of expression, produced in this course can undermine scientific knowledge or specific people. 
++No insult, No harassment and No other acts of verbal/online aggression. This include: Racism, Misogyny, Transphobia, homophobia, religious bigotry, or hatred and discrimination of any kind. 
++Presentation All Memes are pulled on the Course Github page
In the last 30 minutes of the tutorial the memes are presented in class. People can vote for their favorite meme and the 3 best memes will be printed on a poster, wich will be spread at the university! 



+ **Assignment preparation**

Recall your bachelor thesis

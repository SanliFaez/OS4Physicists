## Goal: Why open science, how did we get here? 
After this week, one is able to describe what open science is and how people are getting there from the current state of science. 
In a discussion a student can destiginuge between different open science schools and can take a point of view to name consequences of open science. 
Besides that, the international context and access to scientific knowledge is something a student can form an opinion about.

## Keywords student familiarity check week 1
Some of the keywords in syllabs.MD are supposed to be new, while some are most probably familiar for students.

|**New Concepts**|**Familiar Concepts**|
|----------------|---------------|
|Five schools of Open Science|Laboratory life|
|Current state of the conversation (NL, UU, Physics)|Fraud (No joke intended)|
|Amateurism|International context|
|The reproducibility crisis |Trans Disciplinary and interdisciplinary science|
|Access and Emancipation ||
|Community-Discipline-Employer||
|Risks and rewards of Open Science||
|Opposition and counter arguments||

## Lecture: Week 1 
**Topics in lecture**

Five schools of Open Science | Current state of the conversation (NL, UU, Physics) | Access and Emancipation|Community-Discipline-Employer | Laboratory life | International context | Trans Disciplinary and interdisciplinary science



### Lecture format
The first lecture will be in person (real life), in the form of 2 TED-talks of 18 minutes. These will be recorded, in order that it can be part of a future fully remote version of the course and/or students can watch it again later. 

**TED talk 1** Open science - theory and the OS manifest/political point of view.
Explanation of the five schools of Open Science
Discussion at the UU and in NL
Acces and Emancipation
International Context

**TED talk 2** Practical point of view
Trans disciplinary and interdisciplinary science
Laboratory life
Community discipline employer

## Tutorial: Week 1
**Topics in tutorial:**

Amateurism  | The reproducibility crisis | Risks and rewards of Open Science|Opposition and counter arguments|Fraud 

### Tutorial format
+ **Assignment objective**

  During the first tutorial session there are some OS experts in the room. Let’s say a number of N experts, then, the students are also divided in N groups. Together with their group, they will make their first steps in learning about open science. Each group will talk with all of the experts in such a way that the students can ask questions about the topics below. To process the information, every group can choose between one of the deliverables below. 
In a later stage in the course, students need to reflect on this day? 

+ **Possible deliverables**

  Write a group argument/ essay
  | Use the question hour as input for an plenary discussion your group will organise (Takes place In a later week!)
  | Tape the interviews at glue them together as a podcast/radio show. 

+ **Assignment preparation**

  What questions to ask? 
What way of processing? 
Who does what? 
....more?...

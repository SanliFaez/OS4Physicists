## Goal: public engagement: the role of scientists in society; activism and trust in scientists; story-telling and presentation
After this week, students understand the role, responsibilities and interaction of scientists with scientific communities and the general public. 

The students are able to formulate their opinion on the role a scientist must take in society, supported by arguments learned in class. 

Furthermore, they are able to communicate their research to a general audience, using metaphors and storytelling. They can effectively communicate about uncertainty and avoid jargon.

## Keywords student familiarity check week 6

## Tutorial Week 6: How to write a layperson summary of your research
(2x 60 min)
\
**Topics in tutorial:**\
How storytelling works | Jargon | Metaphors | Communicating uncertainty | Narratives and framing

### Tutorial format
+ **Assignment objective**: Write a layperson summary of your research that is easy to understand for a general audience.

+ **Assignment description**
1. Students individually write a layperson summary of maximum 250 words for a previous project (e.g. their Bachelor thesis; if they don't have that they can choose a future project). 
2. Students read each other's layperson summaries and give feedback on the use of jargon, the use of metaphors, communicating uncertainty and narratives and framing.
3. Students rewrite their layperson summary based on the feedback they received.
4. Students check their revised layperson summary for understandability and jargon with a language-check tool (e.g. https://github.com/textstat/textstat)

+ **Assigment submission**: Students submit their revised layperson summary, the feedback they received from their peers, and the output from the language-check tool.

+ **Assignment grading**: The students receive a pass if they submit a layperson summary that passes the language-check tool and that is understandable for a general audience (_note: minimal scores to be decided_).

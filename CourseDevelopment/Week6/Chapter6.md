## Goal: public engagement: story-telling and presentation; activism and trust in scientists
After this week, students understand the role, responsibilities and interaction of scientists with scientific communities and the general public. 
Students have to give a pitch about their other assignments using skills learned in the course. 
Further, the students are able to formulate their opinion on the role a scientist must take in society, supported by arguments learned in class. By taking into account different stakes in the public debate, they can individually reflect critically on other viewpoints.

## Keywords student familiarity check week 6
Some of the keywords in [the syllabus](https://github.com/SanliFaez/OS4Physicists/blob/main/Syllabus_202x.md#week-5-public-engagement-story-telling-and-presentation-activism-and-trust-in-scientists) are probably familiar for students, while some others are new.

## Lecture: Week 5

**Preparation:** Read article about how physics is represented in Dutch newspapers. https://jcom.sissa.it/archive/20/07/JCOM_2007_2021_A02

**Part 1** A short “classic” lecture of 25 min on:\
Academic social contract\
Bounds of expertise\
Naratives and framing\
Trust in science\
Difficulties to reach audience\
Trust in science

**Part 2** Guest lecture & Discussion (60 min)\
On representation of physics in the Netherlands\
Lecture by e.g. [Julia Cramer (Leiden University)](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/julia-cramer#tab-1), followed up by a plenary discussion.


## Tutorial Week 5: What is the role of a scientist in society?\
(2x 60 min)
\
**Topics in tutorial:**\
Metaphors | Communicating uncertainty | possible roles of a scientist

### Tutorial format
+ **Assignment objective**
Students practice presenting and express their points of view, by reflecting on their role as a future scientist or citizen. They will use metaphors to communicate topics of their bachelor research. 

+ **Possible Assignments**
Students can choose between:
++ *A plenary discussion*\
Students are devided in groups of 8. In the first hour of the tutorial session, each group will prepare 5 statements for a plenary debate. 
Possible statements could be: ...\
- Scientists should never work with industry partners
- Scientists should stay away from politics
- Every scientists should be able to explain their research to a fourteen-year-old high-school student

Students should formulate arguments for and against every statement.\

In the second hour of the tutorial all statements go in a (virtual) jar. Five of them will be selected at random.
After that, the group bringing in this statement will introduce it in a few words and the debate wil start (10 min). 
To keep the discussion running, the prepered arguments can be trown in.


++ *A Pitch*\
Students present a pitch of 3 min, to explain why their bachelor thesis is relevant for society. 
The first hour can be used for preparations. In the second part, all pitchers come together to do their pitch. 
\
\
**TODO:** How should these assignments be graded?
+ Use of methaphores
+ Communicating uncertainty in a clear way
+ Reflect on personal role as a scientist

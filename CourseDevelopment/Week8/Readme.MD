Grant writing | Pre-printing & Peer-review | Altmetrics and visibility | Science in transition | literature and referencing. 

### Lecture format 
**Goal: After this lecture, students understand the scientific process**

A short lecture divided in two parts covering the following topics: Grant writing, Pre-printing & Peer-review, Altmetrics and visibility, Science in transition, literature and referencing. 
Each part answers a specific question, regarding a future in science.

**Student preparation:**
+ **!Answer**: How would your work-life look like as a successful scientist in academia, expressed in **five?** keywords in an mindmap? (This mindmap will be used in the tutorial for grading).  See this link for background information about mindmaps: https://www.mindmapping.com/mind-map

**part 1:** How to share your knowledge and claim your place as a researcher in (Open) Science in terms of citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities?

The teacher will answer this question in a talk. At least the following topics are covered: Literature and referencing | Preprinting and peer-review | Altmetrics and visibility. See below for references.

**Part 2:** How to fund a (future) scientific research project?
The teacher will answer this question in a talk. Where at least the following topics are covered:
Science in transition 
DORA, 
Grant writing (a hint to data stewardship covert by tutorial can be made, )
How to write a successful grant application? 
What is traditional
What is expected to be new/ what will be the shift of focus in grant proposals in the (near) future?
See below for references.


## Tutorial: Week 8 Tutorial: Future (Scientific) Job Information Market. 
**Topics in tutorial:**
The covered topics are: Careers in science and beyond | Applying for scientific positions | Data stewardship | the PhD advantage | Recognition and rewards | Mental | health in academia | CV and applications. 

**Goal:** After this tutorial students have an overview of possible career paths. They can formulate their preferences briefly. The ultimate goal is to let students think about their future career (in science).

**Grading:** Every students hands in a motivation of their possible career plan in max. 500 words or a mindmap. This will be graded by a pass/fail. The work, handed in, needs to show arguments based on shared knowledge during the lecture or tutorial session. See below how this document is created. 

** The Idea:** In this tutorial professionals from from Industry, academia and institutions are visiting. They will tell the students about their work in an interactive setting, which works as follows. The students will be divided in groups. In different rounds every group will have a speed date with one of the professionals. In this speeddate, the professional will tell something about their work and the students can ask questions. After every round, students have time to adjust their mind map, witch they **prepared at home**. In the end students have to hand in their mind maps. See step-by-step explanation below, for two possibilities. 

The exact amount of invited professionals, as well as the specific companies and institutions, need to be determined in preparation before the lecture. However, to cover all topics, it is important that at least an ambassador of every **potential job directions** and **Supporting services** below can be present to discuss the subjects in brackets. In this way, students can broaden their view on potential jobs in or outside science. Possible parties and/or people are sub-listed. Beside having knowledge about the work-field, every visiting professional have to bring a typical CV for that field. Also one needs to know the do’s and don’ts for those who consider this career-path.

**Potential job direction**
+ **PhD** [Applying for scientific positions]
  + PhD students from :Theoretical phys, experimental phys, climate phys, complex systems, applied science
+ **TNO**: [Job opportunities, type of jobs at TNO, Role of TNO in (open) science community, Applying for scientific positions, CV and applications]
+ **Scientific governmental institutions** [The PhD advantage, Careers in Science and beyond, Applying for scientific positions, CV and applications]
  + Eg. KNMI, CBS, CPB, PBL, RIVM, Rijkswaterstaat, Ministry of economy and climate, Ministry of finance, …
+ **Teaching:** 
  + Highschool teachers
  + professors
  + HBO teachers: Hendrik Snijder
+**Physics/Tech Industry** 
  + Eg. ASML, Quantum-delta companies, photonics companies, Delft startup centre, Thales,…
  + A-eskwadraat
+ **Banking/Consulting (Non-physics industry):**
  + Eg. DNB, Consultancy firm, ASN-bank, Triodos Bank, 
+ **Politics:**
   + Ask Robbert Dijkgraaf or Jan Terlouw

**Supporting services**
+ **Data steward UU** 
+ **Mental health coach/psychologist UU**
+ **Recognition and reward UU**:
  + Ask prof. dr. Paul Boselie (UU) or dr. Stans de Haas (UU)
+ **Career service UU**

**Step-by-step**: Mindmap - Not so much time scenario
+ step 0: Lecture
+ step 1. Speed dating in groups with professionals. Students can ask questions, take notes and they use  active listening techniques: https://www.mindtools.com/a85f8yd/listening-skills-infographic 
+ step 2: After every speed date, students have time to adjust their prepared mind map. 

**Step-by-Stepp**: Mindmap & Elevator Pitch - Plenty of time scenario
+ Step 0,1,2 above.
+ step 3: Every student will prepare an elevator pitch Individually.They will explain in 30 sec. what career path of the professionals talked with, fits their needs or why they don’t want any of it. Every pitch is 30 seconds maximum and based on the (adjusted) mindmap. Students have to use arguments based on what they learned in step 1.
+ Step 4: After the preparations, Students gather at the professional in their field of interest and perform the pitch in front of the other gathered students. The listening audience (other students+the professional) write down the main arguments the presenter is using. Written in keywords and provided with feedback if needed. (Note: If there are too many people for a specific discipline, one can pitch in the original groups.)
+ step 5: Peer to peer review: The students collect the keywords written down by their peers, and write down comments on it as a matter of reflection. This is the “peer-review” document.
+ Step 6: In the end, everybody hands in this document together with the mindmaps. It will be used to grade with a pass/fail. 
+ Step 7: Since the goal of this tutorial is to let students think about their future career (in science), all handed in feedback forms where clearly all the steps are worked out, can get a “pass”.

**Data stewardship:** An important part of a research plan is data-management. Below, one can find how the Utrecht University deals with data-management. If (new) software is involved, the e-schience centre can help and FAIR-principles can be followed.

**The PhD advantage:** Below are some references talking about the advantage of a PhD. In some cases it may be an advantage to do a PhD, while in other's it is not necessary. It is considerd that having PhD outside academia has just a little advantage over not having a PhD. On the other hand, if one wants to climb the three in R&D, a PhD may be usefull. If somebody is interested in doing research, a PhD can be a good choice. Since this course is designed for Physics students on Master's level, they belong to the STEM comunity as described below.

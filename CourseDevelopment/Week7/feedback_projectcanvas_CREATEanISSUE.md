## Giving feedback on students project canvas 

**Every student** creates (at least) one issue in the main repository, in which you attach the "feedback" label and assign it to those team members owning the subproject. 
The idea is not only to learn how to give/receive constructive feedback, but to learn together and from each other. 
Discussions, created under your issues, are very welcomed. 
You can comment on what you liked about each other's descriptions or asking for missing information. 
Be specific and kind. Below you can find some questions you might want to ask from your fellow students.

## Questions
_(just suggestions)_
* Can you elaborate more on XY ?  
* I do support your ideas on XY, but did you consider... .  
* Why did you choose for this hardware?  
* What specific materials do you need for your experiments?  
* How are you going to measure XY ?  
* I noticed that your group is working on the same problem.  
Can you tell me more about your approach how to solve/attack it?  
* Can you explain more about XY ?

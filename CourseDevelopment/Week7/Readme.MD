## Lecture: Week 7
**Topics in lecture**
Technology transfer | Open strategies and open business models | Scipreneurship; starting a business | Forking vs contributing | IP-Licensing-Conflict of interest


### Lecture format 
**Goal:** After this lecture students understand what choices need to be made, in order to transfer technology, or to contribute to existing technology.

**Topics:** Technology transfer | Open strategies and open business models | Scipreneurship; starting a business | Forking vs contributing | IP-Licensing-Conflict of interest

**student preparation - Answer questions:** 
What did you learn on university what the whole world should benefit from or learn about? 
How should people benefit from/learn about this? 
Tip: If it is hard to formulate an answer, one can think of real world problems that society is facing. 
Motivation, this question will help students to identify transferable technology and knowledge. Furthermore it let them think on whether to contribute or to start something new.

**Lecture format**
The teacher gives a short presentation to explain what questions a scientist will face in transferring knowledge. The keywords above has to be addressed in this talk, which can be done by answering some questions. This is up to the teacher.

What is technology transfer?
Which stakeholders will be involved in this transfer, i.e., for who is this transfer beneficial? 
What legal restrictions and where to find regulations?
A case study of e.g. Dispertech
What kind of open business models are out there and where to find them?
Why needs technology need to be transferred?
Imagine, you have a great idea during your studies and you want to create a business out of it. What challenges will you face? 
What are the (dis)-advantages of transferring knowledge within an existing project (contribution)
What are the (dis)-advantages of transferring knowledge by building up on an existing project (forking)


**Student preparation:**



## Tutorial: Week 7 Tutorial
**Topics in tutorial:** topics from lecture | Creating impact | Moral ambition



**Goal:** After this tutorial students have thoughts about their own ambition in terms of morality and societal impact. Preferable, a student can relate it’s masters program to a specific ambition and can formulate how a specific project/research/product/... within their field of expertise, creates a specific impact. Note that a student’s ambition is a personal choice.

**Students Preparation - Answer the question:**
+ Imagine yourself at the end of your career reflecting on your working-life. What needs to happen in your working life, for you to be happy at that specific moment?
+ What business, project, organisation etc. inspires you?

(Online) **visitors:**
As a kick starter of the tutorial, some people can give a short presentation or a they can send a video message. 
Examples:
+ Ask Rutger Bregman to give the students some advice during the tutorial. 
+ Ask Somebody from the sustainable finance lab


**Grading:** In small groups students will build a business case and prepare a pitch. All the steps are noted on a canvas. Every students hand in their own canvas See below. If all the steps are followed a student can get a pass. 


**The Idea:** There are two possible projects students can work on. They can work on a fictive (open-)business plan/project or they can analyse a successful business/project. In both projects they have to address specific questions.

### **project 1**
Students will work in small groups on a fictive business/project to serve a moral ambition by creating impact.
To structure this process, the groups will go through the rounds below. After every round, they fill in a Canvas, which will be used in the final round to prepare a pitch. At the end of the tutorial every group do their pitch, which will be judged by the rest. The best pitch will win …. 

**round 1:**  What is the mission of the project?
Goal: Definition of the moral ambition of this fictive project/business.
Every group member write down a mission they want to serve in a few keywords. With this, the students create a word cloud, from which a few overlapping key words will be picked.
With this keywords the group will formulate the mission of their fictive business. 
**Hint:** To help the thoughts, one can think of: real world problems that need to be fixed, a new technology that creates new possibilities, an existing technology where people are running in to specific boundaries, .. etc. 

**Round 2:** Making impact! 
As a group answer the questions 
Following this mission, what impact is this business pursuing?
Goal: based on the mission, write down specific goals of the business. For example, 1

**Round 3:** Stakeholders?
Who will benefit from this business and how?
What knowledge is transferred? 
Consolidate all the stakeholders in a drawing.


**Round 4:** Strategy
In what sense is this business open?


**Round 5:** SWOT
What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this new business?


**Round 6:** Prepare the pitch. 
Every group will prepare a pitch, to convince the audience, why their business should be implemented in the real world. 
Before the pitch, they decide if the audience (rest of the students) will act as a board of investors, possible end users, … 
Make sure that mission, impact, stakeholders, strategy: open and forking/contributing?, SWOT is in the pitch

### **project 2**
Instead of working on a fictive business plan, students take a successful business and study it in the following steps. There are similar rounds as in project 1, but in a different order. 


**Round 1:** What stakeholders are involved?
Who will benefit from this business and how?
What knowledge is transferred? 

**Round 2:** What is the strategy of this business?
Is the business strategy open?

**Round 3&4** Try to figure what specific moral ambition this business is following, and in what impact this creates on society. This will be filled in, on the canvas. Does it match personal preferences of the students? 

**Round 5:** SWOT
What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this existing business?
**Round 6:** Pitch
Students prepare a pitch, as in project 1. Instead of their own business, they use their studied business.

## General remarks
Q: Who should be the initiator of impact creation, private organisations or governmental institutions? i.e. Who has to pay for impact creation, the consumer or the taxes payer? **This is a political question**

**Warning/advice**
Don’t judge a job on its title. Making impact is becoming popular among (young) employees, so the word ‘impact’ may be a bit of buzz word. So to avoid disappointment, always check if the job details lay within one's personal moral ambition to judge a job.

Some problems are systematic problems. If the system leaves solutions to the consumer, by ,e.g., making it a choice to go for a sustainable option or not, the system will never change.

+ **Measuring impact:** Lots has been written about measuring impact. The way impact is measured is a political choice, since not every measurable quantity can be monitored in society. So one have to decide what to measure. In physics quantities such as temperature are well defined and can be measured with a thermometer. In society this is less straightforward. Regarding the political landscape there are different parameters people are interested in and the way people look at data are causing there viewpoint.?  As an example, take the housing market challenges in the Netherlands, some people will say the problem is the affordability of houses, while others will say it is the amount of houses causing problems. There is no objective answer, since the answer depends on what is important for people. Below are some references regarding measuring impact.

## About the ./projects directory

To keep the repository tidy, files for each subproject MUST be kept inside a subdirectory in ./projects/

To create the subdirectory, use the naming convention ProjectName_TeamMembers.

Create the necessary directory structure inside the project subdirector, and write the navigation instructions in a README.md file inside that subfolder.
The preferred text style is Markdown.
